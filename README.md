# Financial Planner

In this project I've used API's to build two financial analysis tools. The first one is a personal finance planner that allows users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess whether or not they have enough money as an emergency fund. The second tool is a retirement planning tool that uses the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices of stocks and bonds, it then runs Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance over 30 years. I then use the data collected from the Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the expected portfolio returns given a specific initial investment amount.
